# Color system

The color palette system used in Frosted UI is the [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) system.

There is a number of 12 step color scales available, each with their own light, dark and alpha variants.

Colors are grouped into 3 categories: `accents`, `grays`, and `semantic` (info, success, warning, danger).
All of these can be specified on your `<Theme />`, or per component where appropriate.

## Understanding the scale

To understand how the scale works and what's the main use case for each color step,
please refer to this detailed explanation of the [Radix Colors scale](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale) system.
