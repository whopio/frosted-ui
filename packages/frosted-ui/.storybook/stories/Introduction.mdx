# Welcome to Frosted UI

Frosted is the design system used by [Whop](https://whop.com) and heavily based on [Radix Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

The library is still a work in progress so you might expect some breaking changes.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/whopio/frosted-ui-v2).
