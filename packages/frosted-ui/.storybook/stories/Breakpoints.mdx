# Breakpoints

Breakpoints allow you to build responsive layouts based on different screen sizes.

## Available breakpoints

Breakpoints are `min-width` based (mobile-first) and apply when the screen width is equal or greater than given breakpoint.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Size</td>
    <td>Screen</td>
    <td>Width</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>initial</td>
    <td>Phones (portrait)</td>
    <td>0px</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xs</td>
    <td>Phones (landscape)</td>
    <td>520px</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sm</td>
    <td>Tablets (portrait)</td>
    <td>768px</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>md</td>
    <td>Tablets (landscape)</td>
    <td>1024px</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>lg</td>
    <td>Laptops</td>
    <td>1280px</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>xl</td>
    <td>Desktops</td>
    <td>1640px</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Usage

Most component size and layout props will accept additional `Responsive` object for modifying the given prop across breakpoints.

Each size maps to a corresponding key, the value of each will be applied when the screen size is greater than or equal to the named breakpoint.

```tsx
<Heading
  size={{
    initial: '3',
    md: '5',
    xl: '7',
  }}
/>
```
